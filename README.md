# ETF_Exploration
***
## This project will look at using the OpenBB SDK and a few of its powerful functions to quickly access data on a popular stock index ETF, DIA. 
## The OpenBB SDK is an open source python library that allows the end user to access and analyze vast amount of financial data. OpenBB documentation can be found at: https://docs.openbb.co/

### This project just scratches the surface of what is available in the OpenBB SDK, its power and ease of use.  I not only learned a ton about OpenBB but am extremely excited to dive into and learn all it has to offer!
